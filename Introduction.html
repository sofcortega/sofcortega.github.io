    My name is Sofia Ortega, I’m a Digital Storytelling major with a minor in Art! I wouldn’t say I have much experience in web application or development experience, but I did learn very minor basic coding information in middle school and am also familiar with Twine, a free game development software that utilizes hyperlinks for storytelling. My expectation for this course is to learn more about web development and coding so that I can make my own portfolio website from scratch if possible or at least be more informed about how to make my own website without relying on Squarespace or something. My favorite hobby is either making jewelry or designing art concepts on Photoshop. I also really enjoy scrolling through Pinterest and building a concept that way.
