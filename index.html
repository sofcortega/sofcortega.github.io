    <p> This website is a curation of all my work that Iâ€™ve completed in the past as well as a glimpse into what I seek to create in the future. Through all the different mediums of work I take part in, there is a common thread I follow where those mediums are used to communicate experiences involving memory and its frailty as well as the tie between devotional practices and self expression in artwork. Throughout both digital and physical mediums, there are a million different ways to communicate these ideas, and I seek to focus on the intersection of Latinidad and girlhood that affects my perception of these ideas. With the work I present for your consideration, I hope that you enjoy the work and are able to think more deeply about it and/or connect with it on some level of your own. </p>
